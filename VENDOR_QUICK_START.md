## 🎯 How It Works

### For Vendors:
1. Visit `/vendor/onboarding`
2. Click "Start Your Application"
3. Fill out 4-step form:
   - Personal Information
   - Business Information  
   - Address Information
   - Service Categories
4. Submit application
5. Receive confirmation email
6. Wait for admin approval (2-3 days)
7. Get access to vendor dashboard

### For You (Admin):
1. Vendor applies through form
2. Vendor data saved to MongoDB
3. Email notification sent
4. Review application in admin panel (to be built)
5. Approve/reject vendor
6. Approved vendors can upload services

  phone: "+1234567890",
